## ðŸ’¡ Quick Demo

```bash
# 1. clone & move inside
git clone https://github.com/ndkhoa211/ReAct-agent-from-scratch.git
cd ReAct-agent-from-scratch

# 2. create an isolated env (recommended)
uv venv          # creates .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# 3. install runtime deps
uv pip install -e .

# 4. add your OpenAI key
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-..." > .env

# 5. run it!
python main.py
```

Output:
```

    Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:

    get_text_length(text: str) -> int - Returns the length of a text by characters

    Use the following format:

    Question: the input question you must answer
    Thought: you should always think about what to do
    Action: the action to take, should be one of [get_text_length]
